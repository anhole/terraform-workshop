# Terraform workshop

Welcome to Terraform Workshop repo. This repo intends to give more advanced examples and showing some strategies
for using Terraform in larger real world environments.

## Prerequisites

The workshops focuses on Terraform and tries to avoid implementation in a specific Cloud provider. This is done
by heavy use of `local` resources. This means you only have to install Terraform to go through the demos, no
credentials for a provider is needed.
